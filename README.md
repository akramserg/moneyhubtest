/generatecsv
As I wasn't sure if I needed to send an CSV file to export or just a CSV formatted object I did that latter to save time. I could come back and stream the file later.
At the moment, when /generatecsv is called on the admin server, it formats the data, generates a CSV file and store it locally and send the CSV formatted object to export.
